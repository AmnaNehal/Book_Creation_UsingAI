This is a placeholder for the URDF structure diagram.
In a real implementation, this would be an SVG or PNG image showing:
- A robot model with multiple links connected by joints
- Example of a humanoid robot structure
- Visual representation of links, joints, and kinematic chains
- How URDF describes the relationship between different parts
